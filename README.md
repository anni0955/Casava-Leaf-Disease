# Casava Leaf Disease
 This repository contains an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline for Cassava Leaf Disease Classification, built using TensorFlow & Keras, and trained on the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset. The project demonstrates a progressive modeling strategy, starting from a custom CNN and evolving into transfer learning and fine-tuning with EfficientNetB0.
